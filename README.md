# Perceptron Classifier Implementation

This project implements a Perceptron classifier, which is a type of linear classifier used in machine learning. The Perceptron is designed to classify data points into two categories based on a linear decision boundary. The notebook includes the following features:

Data Preparation: Generates a synthetic dataset using make_blobs for binary classification.
Perceptron Class: Implements the Perceptron algorithm with methods for training and prediction.
Visualization: Displays decision boundaries and training progress.
